# Full stack Javascript environment

Web development is often performed using one programming language for the frotend and one for the backend. This often means certain business logics has to be repeated once in each respective language. By using Javascript for both frontend and backend, we make it possible to reuse code between the two. In addition, having the same language on both client and server it makes it easier to synchronize data between the two.

It can also be argued that Javascript is growing into a formidable programming language, with huge potential for the future. Since virtually all browsers on all devices run Javascript, it can be argued that Javascript is perhaps the most widespread programming language in the world, and might even become THE most important programming language in the world.

Javascript also has some strenghts in its own right, besides from beeing widespread. Javascript was developed at a time when compiled languages such as Java and C++ reigned supreme for application development, and it is therefore understandable that borrows much of it syntax, and even parts of its name from Java. The true nature of Javascript however, is more that of a functional and dynamic language like Lisp or ML from the 70'ties, hiding beneath a thin imperative veneer. Webb development has brought a renaissance for dynamic programming languages in general, and Javascript has proven that concepts such as dynamic data structures and lexical closures (functions with encapsulated scope that can be passed around) are extremley powerful, especially when it comes to creating frameworks.
