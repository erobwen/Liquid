Things to do:

* Support shape constraints: nonrecursive, tree, acyclic, graph

* Complete DAG ui support, as a proof of concept.

* Add a nice look n feel.
    consider how to deal with screen sizes.
    material design for react.

* Work on readme file.
    split to several files
    add images
    describe infusion.

* Sort order for all relations.

* Think through datatypes support:
    'variable' (just an observable variable)
    'set' (an ordered set with immutable order)
    'ordered_set'  (a dictionary with "true" as value for included objects +  a sequence defining the order)
    'sequence' (an array under 128 elements, then grows into an AVL tree, it should be possible to decorate tree nodes with cached methods etc.)
    'dictionary' (improved from Javascript with possibility to use objects as indexes, implicitly using their id, uses a sequence for underlying storage).

* Make database work again.
    Switch to MongoDB

* Different animations on:
       change field from upstream.
       changed field by repeater
       added/removed subtree from upstream
       (added/removed subtree by repeater)

* Client side routing with url/browser navigation support.

* Object version control.

* Liquid server clustering. It should be possible to organize Liquid servers in cluster-trees where end users communicate with leafs, and where the cluster tree act as a multi level data-cache.
