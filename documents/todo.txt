Things to do:

* Complete DAG ui support, as a proof of concept.
    * Able to sort sub categories, and remember sort order. (distinguish between drop beside, drop underneath)
    * Able to dissconnect a child category
    * Able to auto-disconnect to previous parent(s) by ctrl-move.
    * Able to create/delete category
    * Support for single-duplicate open.

* Add a nice look n feel.
    consider how to deal with screen sizes.
    Use material design for react?

* Reactive animations animations on:
       change field from upstream.
       changed field by repeater
       added/removed subtree from upstream
       (added/removed subtree by repeater)

* Work on readme file.
    split to several files
    add images
    describe infusion.

* Sort order for all relations.

* Think through datatypes support:
    'variable' (just an observable variable)
    'set' (an ordered set with immutable order)
    'ordered_set'  (a dictionary with "true" as value for included objects +  a sequence defining the order)
    'sequence' (an array under 128 elements, then grows into an AVL tree, it should be possible to decorate tree nodes with cached methods etc.)
    'dictionary' (improved from Javascript with possibility to use objects as indexes, implicitly using their id, uses a sequence for underlying storage).

* Make database work again.
    Switch to MongoDB

* Enable GC properly.
    * Remove idObjectMap on server
    These are the places where we need to store references to objects:
    * Add page footprint maps
    * keepAliveCache with N number of entries (last requested first, culled at the end)
    * keepAliveStatic (manual insertion removal)
    * Keep alive waiting for DB write operation (when writing)


* Client side routing with url/browser navigation support.

* Object version control.

* Liquid server clustering. It should be possible to organize Liquid servers in cluster-trees where end users communicate with leafs, and where the cluster tree act as a multi level data-cache.
