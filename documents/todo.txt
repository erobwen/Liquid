Things to do:


New data types:
    Dictionary
    Set (augment object with id)
    OrderedSet
    Sequence

* Make objects into dictionaries.

* Make persistent
    * cached functions.
    * repeaters
    * projection

* Implement new data structure funtionality, more harmonious with javascript.
    * Supply arrays of infinite size (auto indexing for larger arrays)
    * Supply hash maps of infinite size.
    * Supply indexed sets of infinite size.

* Container objects, and indirect relations.
    * A relation is rooted at an index (property) in the object hash, map, then goes across all container objects.

* Incoming chronological indexes

* Make incoming relations load, up to a limit.

* Sort order for all relations.


...

* Complete DAG ui support, as a proof of concept.
    * Able to sort sub categories, and remember sort order. (distinguish between drop beside, drop underneath)
    * Able to dissconnect a child category
    * Able to auto-disconnect to previous parent(s) by ctrl-move.
    * Able to create/delete category
    * Support for single-duplicate open.

* Add a nice look n feel.
    consider how to deal with screen sizes.
    Use material design for react?

* Reactive animations animations on:
       change field from upstream.
       changed field by repeater
       added/removed subtree from upstream
       (added/removed subtree by repeater)


* Make database work again.
    Switch to MongoDB

* Enable GC properly.
    * Remove idObjectMap on server
    These are the places where we need to store references to objects:
    * Add page footprint maps
    * keepAliveCache with N number of entries (last requested first, culled at the end)
    * keepAliveStatic (manual insertion removal)
    * Keep alive waiting for DB write operation (when writing)


* Client side routing with url/browser navigation support.

* Object version control.

* Liquid server clustering. It should be possible to organize Liquid servers in cluster-trees where end users communicate with leafs, and where the cluster tree act as a multi level data-cache.
